<h2>Who is Tina</h2> 
	<p>My name is Tina, and sometimes it’s Dina, but most of the time it’s Tina. My middle name is Ruth, you can call me that too. </p>
	
	<p>I live with a guy named Bob. He is my dad. I have a mom named Linda, a brother named Gene, and a sister named Louise. I live with them too.</p>

	<p>I’m a 13-year-old fry cook at Bob’s Burgers. Bob is my dad. I consider myself to be smart, strong, sensual women. My boyfriend who I have spent 3000 fantasy hours with (AKA Jimmy Jr.) thinks so too, especially in my erotic friend fiction. He forgets that we are dating in real life. You can read some, or listen to me sensually read it to you with great inflection, in the navigation bar. </p>
	
	<p>Tina, me, is also a very complex women. My interests (also shown in the navigation bar) illustrate this. I have 8 and a half size feet. I am also left-handed, a recovered thumbsucker, wear a retainer, dislike parrots, and am the secretary of a Boyz4Now fan club.

	<p>I am a full packed package, but like I always say, "I'm no hero, I put my bra on one boob at a time like everyone else."</p>
