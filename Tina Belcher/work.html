<p>Hi, I'm Tina again. In addition to being a sass master, I also like to write erotic friend fiction. What is erotic friend fiction you ask?</p> 

<p>Erotic friend fiction is a form of art. It involves writing possible true stories that are currently fake. It uses your friends as characters combined with things that are erotic. This could be butts, Jimmy Junior, or zombies for instance.</p> 

<h3>Below is me reading some of my personal erotic friend fiction out loud:<h3>

<p>My frien-emy, Tammy, tried to use my erotic friend fiction against me. She told me that if I didn't go into bad Tina mode whenever she wanted, she would tell Jimmy Junior about his part in my writing. I was so afraid at first, and gave into the peer pressure. But, after a while, I got tired. I shouldn't be ashamed of who I am and what I write. My parents gave me the idea to read it out loud. They even ran to the school to hear me frantically. (Later I found out that it was to stop me, but they had good intentions.)</p> 

<h2>Announcement</h2>
	<p>I'm extremely excited to announce that my latest friend fiction, "Butts in all Places and Spaces," will be turned into a documentary in the near future. Here's the latest trailer.</p>
